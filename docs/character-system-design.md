# Character System Design

## Overview

The Narrative Engine character system provides a flexible, game-agnostic framework for character creation and persistence that can adapt to any game genre or ruleset.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Character Creation Configuration
Each game defines its own `character-creation.yaml` that specifies:
- **Creation Flow**: Ordered steps in character generation
- **Schema Definition**: What data fields are needed
- **Validation Rules**: Constraints and requirements
- **Options and Methods**: Game-specific creation methods

### 2. Character Schema
A flexible JSON-like structure that can represent:
- **D&D Characters**: Classes, races, ability scores, equipment
- **Space Games**: Ship types, reputation, credits, licenses
- **Detective Games**: Skills, knowledge areas, contacts, cases
- **Survival Games**: Health stats, crafting skills, inventory

### 3. Character Persistence
Characters are stored in the state system with:
- Git versioning for character evolution
- Support for multiple characters per player
- Character templates for quick starts
- Import/export functionality

## Implementation Examples

### D&D 5e Character
```yaml
character:
  identity:
    name: "Aragorn"
    race: "human"
    class: "ranger"
    level: 5
    background: "outlander"
  abilities:
    strength: 16
    dexterity: 14
    constitution: 14
  equipment:
    weapons: ["longsword", "longbow"]
    armor: "leather_armor"
```

### Space Trader Character
```yaml
character:
  identity:
    name: "Captain Reynolds"
    profession: "smuggler"
    reputation: "neutral"
  ship:
    model: "firefly_class"
    name: "Serenity"
    cargo_capacity: 100
  resources:
    credits: 5000
    fuel: 75
  licenses:
    - "basic_pilot"
    - "cargo_transport"
```

### Detective Character
```yaml
character:
  identity:
    name: "Sherlock Holmes"
    profession: "private_investigator"
    agency: "221B Baker Street"
  skills:
    observation: "master"
    deduction: "master"
    chemistry: "expert"
  knowledge:
    - "criminal_psychology"
    - "london_underground"
    - "toxicology"
  contacts:
    - { name: "Lestrade", role: "police_inspector" }
    - { name: "Mycroft", role: "government_official" }
```

## Character Creation Flow

### 1. Game Detection
When starting a new game, the engine checks for `character-creation.yaml`

### 2. Guided Creation
The UI presents creation steps based on the configuration:
- Step-by-step wizard interface
- Validation at each step
- Preview before finalization

### 3. Quick Start Options
- Pre-generated characters
- Random generation
- Template-based creation
- Import from file

### 4. Persistence
Characters are saved to:
```
game-state/
├── characters/
│   ├── player-character.yaml
│   ├── backup/
│   └── templates/
```

## MCP Server Integration

### character-mcp Server
New MCP server dedicated to character management:

```typescript
interface CharacterMCP {
  // Creation
  createCharacter(config: CharacterConfig): Character
  validateCharacter(character: Partial<Character>): ValidationResult
  
  // Management
  getCharacter(id: string): Character
  updateCharacter(id: string, updates: Partial<Character>): Character
  levelUp(id: string): Character
  
  // Templates
  getTemplates(): CharacterTemplate[]
  generateRandom(constraints?: Constraints): Character
}
```

## UI Components

### Character Sheet
- Responsive layout adapting to game type
- Real-time stat calculations
- Inline editing with validation
- Visual indicators for conditions/status

### Creation Wizard
- Multi-step form with progress indicator
- Context-sensitive help
- Live preview panel
- Undo/redo support

### Character Switcher
- Quick character switching for multi-character games
- Character portraits/avatars
- Status summary view

## Advanced Features

### 1. Character Evolution
- Automatic tracking of character changes
- Milestone snapshots
- Branching for "what-if" scenarios

### 2. Multi-Character Support
- Party management for group games
- NPC adoption as player characters
- Character relationships/bonds

### 3. Cross-Game Compatibility
- Export characters in standard formats
- Character conversion between similar systems
- Universal character traits

### 4. AI Integration
- LLM-generated backstories
- Personality-consistent dialogue suggestions
- Character behavior predictions

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Adapts to any game system
2. **Persistence**: Full history with Git versioning
3. **Validation**: Ensures valid character states
4. **Templates**: Quick start options
5. **Evolution**: Characters grow over time
6. **Portability**: Import/export support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Character Builder**: Drag-drop interface
2. **Character Portraits**: AI-generated or uploaded
3. **Social Features**: Share characters online
4. **Achievement System**: Track character accomplishments
5. **Character Voice**: AI voice synthesis matching personality
