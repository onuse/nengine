# Quick Start - Creative Server Integration

## What's Done ✅

Your Narrative Engine now uses the creative server exclusively:
- ✅ Text generation with Llama 3.3 70B (working perfectly!)
- ✅ Image generation infrastructure (ready when backend fixed)
- ✅ Ollama completely removed (no fallbacks)

## Start Using It Now

### 1. Update Game Config

```yaml
# games/your-game/game.yaml
llm:
  provider: creative-server
  model: llama-3.3-70b-abliterated
  temperature: 0.9
  contextWindow: 32000
```

### 2. Run Your Game

```bash
npm run dev -- --game=your-game
```

That's it! You're now using the 70B model.

## For Server Team

**Image generation has an issue** - see [IMAGE_GENERATION_ISSUE.md](IMAGE_GENERATION_ISSUE.md)

**TL;DR**: Backend at `localhost:8083` returns 404. Text generation works perfectly.

## Performance

- **Text**: 4.3 tokens/sec (excellent quality)
- **Images**: 30-180 seconds (when backend fixed)

## Benefits

- Much better narrative quality (70B vs 9B)
- 32K context window
- Uncensored for mature content
- No local GPU needed
