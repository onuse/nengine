  # Extra narrative instructions
  extraInstructions: |
    This is a gritty, atmospheric dark fantasy game.

    Style Guidelines:
    - Use vivid, sensory descriptions (smells, sounds, textures)
    - Create morally complex characters with realistic motivations
    - Build tension through atmosphere and character interactions
    - Don't shy away from darker themes, but handle them maturely
    - NPCs should have depth - they lie, manipulate, and have hidden agendas

    Combat should be brutal and consequential.
    Social interactions should be as engaging as action sequences.
    Every choice should have weight.

# The rest of your game content goes here...
# NPCs defined in content/npcs.yaml will automatically get portrait generation
# Rooms defined in content/rooms.yaml can use scene image generation
