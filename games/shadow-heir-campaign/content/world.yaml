    name: "The Elfsong Tavern - Private Hall"
    description: |
      The private third-floor hall of the Elfsong Tavern pulses with celebration. Thirty members of the Shadow Thieves toast your greatest heist yet - the Silverstar Diamond, now gleaming on a pedestal at the room's center. Zara Nightwhisper, your mentor for the past decade, holds her wine glass high.

      Then she stumbles. The glass shatters. Red wine spreads across the floor like blood.

      She collapses into your arms, her lips already turning blue. Her hand presses something warm and crystalline into your palm. "Trust... no one..." she gasps. "Find the Gray Hand in... Waterdeep..."

      Across the room, Keth Shadowblade's eyes lock onto yours above Zara's dying body. His hand moves to his blade. "YOU!" he roars. "You murdered her!"

      Vex the Viper stands by the door, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth as he calls out: "Seal the exits! No one leaves!"

      The crystal burns warm in your fist. Thirty thieves stare at you. Some reach for weapons. Others back toward the windows. The celebration has become your execution.

    story_notes: |
      This is the OPENING SCENE. The player should feel:
      - Shock and grief (mentor dying)
      - Immediate mortal danger
      - Betrayal (who poisoned her?)
      - Mystery (what IS this crystal?)
      - Urgency (must escape NOW)

      Multiple escape routes possible:
      - Fight (suicidal but possible)
      - Talk (very hard but might split the crowd)
      - Window escape (classic thief move)
      - Hostage/leverage the crystal
      - Create distraction and run

      Zara's last words are cryptic:
      - "Trust no one" - someone here betrayed her
      - "Gray Hand" - Harper contact
      - "Waterdeep" - your destination
      - The crystal is Harper communication device (player doesn't know yet)

      You're clinging to the rain-slicked stone wall three stories above Baldur's Gate's Lower City. The sounds of pursuit echo from the window above - shouts, breaking furniture, Keth's voice roaring your name.

      Below, the Elfsong's famous ghost still sings her haunting melody, echoing through the night. The alley below is dark but you can see movement - city watch on patrol? Or more Shadow Thieves cutting off escape?

      To your left, a drain pipe runs down to street level. To your right, a balcony one floor down belongs to a merchant's room - curtains drawn but lamplight visible inside. Above, angry faces appear at the window you just climbed through.

      The crystal pulses warm in your pocket. Your fingers ache from gripping the stonework. Choose quickly.

    description: |
      The alley reeks of piss, rotting fish, and desperation - the authentic smell of Baldur's Gate's Lower City. Shadows pool between crates and barrels. The ghost's song echoes hauntingly from above, giving the alley its name.

      Two city watch patrol the street at the alley's mouth, their lanterns swinging. They haven't seen you yet. Behind you, the Elfsong's back door - service entrance, usually guarded but maybe chaos inside has pulled them away?

      To your left, a sewer grate. To your right, a narrow gap between buildings leading toward the Gray Harbor docks. The crystal's warmth reminds you - they're hunting you now. Every choice matters.

      The ghost sings: "Beware the smiling viper..." Zara's favorite song. A coincidence? Or a message from beyond death?

    description: |
      The docks of Baldur's Gate never sleep, but at this hour they're the domain of smugglers, prostitutes, and those who prefer darkness to daylight. Ships creak against their moorings. Fog rolls in from the Chionthar River, thick enough to hide sins.

      A dozen ships crowd the harbor - merchant vessels, fishing boats, and one black-sailed ship that flies no flag. Sailors stumble between taverns, too drunk to notice a fugitive. But the Flaming Fist has a garrison at the harbor mouth, and their torches cut through the fog like orange eyes.

      A halfling dockworker eyes you nervously, then looks away - he knows trouble when he sees it. A ship's captain argues with a customs officer, their raised voices providing cover. The black-sailed ship's gangplank is unguarded...

      The crystal pulses faster near the water. Why?

    description: |
      The labyrinthine back streets of Baldur's Gate's Lower City are a thief's natural habitat. Narrow, winding passages between leaning buildings that block out the stars. Laundry lines stretch overhead like banners. Beggars sleep in doorways. Watch patrols avoid these streets after dark.

      But tonight you're not the predator - you're prey. Every shadow could hide a Shadow Thief. Every corner could lead to ambush. The crystal's warmth is your only comfort, though you still don't know what it is or why Zara gave it to you.

      Three paths diverge: The Blushing Mermaid tavern (neutral ground where thieves trade information), the Counting House (where you have money hidden), or deeper into the warrens toward the Outer City and possible escape.

      A cat yowls. Footsteps echo from somewhere. They're searching for you.

      This infamous dive tavern is neutral ground by ancient accord - no blood spilled inside, all disputes held at the door. The clientele would make a paladin weep: cutthroats, smugglers, prostitutes, fences, and informants. The ale is watered, the wine is vinegar, but the information flows like gold.

      The moment you enter, conversations pause. Eyes assess you. Word travels fast in the underworld - they know about Zara. They know you're hunted. The question is: do they see you as a lucrative bounty, a potential ally, or just another corpse-to-be?

      The barkeep, a scarred dwarf called Grimjaw, watches you with calculating eyes. In the corner booth, a hooded figure makes a subtle hand signal - guild sign for "talk, don't kill." But is it genuine or bait?

      The crystal throbs against your chest. Someone here knows what it is.

      But getting in won't be easy. The entrance is watched. The guards are competent. And if word has spread about you, they might have orders to detain anyone matching your description.

      However, you know secrets. There's a ventilation shaft on the east wall - tight, uncomfortable, but possible. There's a sewer connection the guards don't know about. Or you could try the direct approach: disguise, bribery, or brazen confidence. You're a thief. This is what you do.

      The question is: is 500 gold worth the risk of capture?

    description: |
      The sewers of Baldur's Gate are a city beneath the city. Brick archways two centuries old, running water carrying the filth of 100,000 souls, and darkness that hides a thousand secrets. Thieves use these tunnels. So do smugglers, cultists, and things that were human once.

      This junction connects five tunnels. Rust-colored water flows ankle-deep, carrying things you don't want to identify. Phosphorescent fungi provide sickly green light. Rats watch from ledges with eyes that gleam with unnatural intelligence.

      The walls are marked with thieves' cant symbols. You recognize some: "Watch patrol route," "Hidden cache," "Danger - claimed territory." But there's a new one you don't recognize - a symbol like a crystal surrounded by eyes. It glows faintly, matching the pulse of the crystal in your pocket.

      Something echoes in the tunnels. Footsteps? Water? Or something worse?

      These tunnels predate Baldur's Gate by centuries - perhaps millennia. Smooth stone walls covered in faded runes that make your eyes hurt to study. The air is cold, stale, and carries a faint hum like distant machinery or sleeping magic.

      The crystal in your pocket blazes with heat now, casting blue-white light that reflects off the ancient stone. The runes respond to its presence, glowing faintly. This is significant. Zara led you here - no, the crystal led you here.

      At the tunnel's end, a door of black stone covered in the same symbol you saw in the sewers: a crystal surrounded by eyes. Harper magic. Zara was a Harper agent. The truth crystallizes like ice in your gut.

      Everything you thought you knew was a lie. The Shadow Thieves, your whole life - cover for her true mission. And now you've inherited it.

      The door's lock mechanism is arcane, not mechanical. The crystal throbs in your hand. Touch it to the door?

    description: |
      The brass key from Zara's body opens this door. The apartment is small but well-maintained,
      hidden above a cooper's shop in Lower City. You never knew this place existed.
      
      The room is neat - too neat. Everything arranged with precision. A desk, a bed, a wardrobe.
      But your trained eye spots the signs: false panel in the wardrobe, hollow space under the floorboard,
      secret compartment in the desk's base.
      
      This is where Zara kept her secrets. Her real secrets. Harper secrets.
      
      On the desk: her journal, bound in leather. In the wardrobe: her cloak, her lockpicks, a change of clothes.
      Under the floorboard: emergency gold, false papers, three different identity kits.
      In the desk: letters in code, a wooden Harper token, and maps of Baldur's Gate marking locations with Harper symbols.
      
      She was preparing for something. Or running from something. Or both.

    description: |
      The black stone door opens to your crystal's touch. Blue light floods the chamber beyond.
      
      This is a Harper safe house - perhaps the oldest in Baldur's Gate. The room is circular,
      carved from living stone. Ancient runes cover every surface, glowing faintly with Harper magic.
      
      In the center: a pedestal designed to hold the crystal. Around the walls: shelves of encoded books,
      maps of Faerun with Harper networks marked, and supplies for agents in need.
      
      A magical voice echoes when you enter - Zara's voice, pre-recorded by Harper magic:
      "If you're hearing this, I'm dead. The crystal found you, so you're my heir. Listen carefully:
      The Zhentarim have infiltrated the Shadow Thieves. Vex the Viper is Manshoon's agent.
      Take the crystal to the Gray Hand in Waterdeep. They'll know what to do.
      I'm sorry I lied. But I loved you true. Now run, child. Run north and don't look back."
      
      The voice fades. The truth settles heavy as stone.

      The deck of Captain Darkwater's ship. Black sails furled, crew moving with practiced efficiency.
      No flag, no loyalty, no questions - the perfect escape from Baldur's Gate.
      
      Captain Jendara Darkwater stands at the wheel, eyes sharp as she assesses you.
      "Running from something or running to something?" she asks. "Don't answer - I don't care.
      Passage to Waterdeep is 500 gold. Or if you're handy with a blade, work your way north.
      We sail at dawn."
      
      The crystal pulses warmer near her. Why? Is she Harper? Or does she just hate Zhentarim?

      or too wanted to live within Baldur's Gate proper. No walls here, no watch patrols.
      Just refugees, criminals, and desperate folk trying to survive.
      
      This is where you disappear if you need to vanish. Where you find people who'll do anything for gold.
      Where the roads north begin - toward Candlekeep, toward Waterdeep, toward whatever comes next.
      
      The choice is yours: Stay in Baldur's Gate and prove your innocence, or run north with the crystal
      and never look back.
