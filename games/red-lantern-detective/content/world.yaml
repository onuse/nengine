    description: |-
      Rain slicks the cobblestones outside the Red Lantern, the city's most notorious establishment. 
      A discreet red lantern hangs beside an unmarked door, casting crimson shadows on the wet street.
      The muffled sound of jazz music and laughter drifts from within, along with the sweet scent of gin and perfume.
      Two burly doormen eye you suspiciously - this isn't the kind of place that welcomes uninvited guests.

    name: "The Red Lantern - Main Floor"
    description: |-
      Smoke hangs thick in the air of the main speakeasy, lit by dim amber lights and the glow of cigarettes.
      A jazz quartet plays in the corner while well-dressed patrons sip illegal cocktails at small round tables.
      The bar dominates one wall, staffed by a sharp-eyed bartender who sees everything.
      A grand staircase leads upstairs where the 'private rooms' are located - the establishment's other business.
      Tonight feels different though... there's tension beneath the usual revelry.

  - id: "private_stairs"
    name: "Private Staircase"
    description: |-
      A carpeted staircase leads to the establishment's upper floor, where the Red Lantern's more intimate services are offered.
      Velvet wallpaper and soft lighting create an atmosphere of luxury and discretion.
      Muffled voices and occasional laughter drift from behind closed doors.
      A stern-looking woman in expensive dress watches who comes and goes - nothing happens here without Madame Rouge's knowledge.

    name: "Upstairs Hallway"
    description: |-
      A long hallway lined with numbered doors, each leading to a private room.
      Rich carpet muffles footsteps while ornate light fixtures cast warm, intimate lighting.
      The air carries mixed scents of perfume, cigarettes, and something else... something metallic.
      Room 7's door stands slightly ajar - unusual for this establishment's reputation for discretion.

  - id: "room_7"
    name: "Private Room 7 - Crime Scene"
    description: |-
      The scene that greets you is grim. What should have been an intimate private room has become a crime scene.
      Expensive furnishings are in disarray - an overturned lamp, scattered clothing, a mirror cracked by impact.
      Dark stains on the Persian rug tell a story of violence in a place meant for pleasure.
      The window stands open, curtains billowing in the night breeze - an escape route or invitation to disaster?

  - id: "madame_office"
    name: "Madame Rouge's Office"
    description: |-
      The business heart of the Red Lantern, where Madame Rouge manages both the speakeasy and the more intimate services.
      An imposing mahogany desk dominates the room, covered with ledgers, photographs, and correspondence.
      Filing cabinets line the walls - records of clients, employees, and business arrangements.
      A hidden safe behind a painting suggests even more sensitive information is kept here.
      Madame Rouge sits behind her desk like a spider in her web, watching your every move.

  - id: "alley_entrance"
    name: "Back Alley"
    description: |-
      A narrow alley behind the Red Lantern, reeking of garbage and broken dreams.
      Fire escapes zigzag up the building's back wall, providing discrete exits for those who prefer not to be seen.
      Empty bottles and discarded items litter the ground - evidence of the establishment's hidden activities.
      A homeless veteran warming himself by a trash fire might have seen more than anyone realizes.

    name: "Basement Storage"
    description: |-
      Beneath the glamour of the Red Lantern lies a more practical space - storage for liquor, supplies, and secrets.
      Crates of illegal alcohol line the walls alongside more mysterious containers.
      The air is thick with the smell of gin and something else... something that suggests the Red Lantern's business extends beyond pleasure.
      A locked door at the far end bears no marking but seems heavily reinforced.

  - id: "police_station"
    name: "Metropolitan Police Station"
    description: |-
      The city's main police station buzzes with activity even at this late hour.
      Detectives work at cluttered desks while suspects and witnesses wait on hard wooden benches.
      The corruption of prohibition-era law enforcement is evident - some officers seem suspiciously well-dressed for their salaries.
      Your captain's office door is always open, but his loyalty to justice versus political pressure remains an open question.

  - id: "rainy_street"
    name: "Rain-Soaked City Street"
    description: |-
      The city street gleams with rain under the glow of street lamps and neon signs.
      1920s automobiles navigate between horse-drawn carts - a city caught between old and new.
      The Red Lantern's crimson glow competes with other establishments' lights in this district known for its loose morals and looser laws.
      Every shadow could hide a witness, a criminal, or a corrupt official - in this city, they're often the same person.
