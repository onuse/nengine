      name: "Congressman's Letter Opener"
      description: |-
        An ornate silver letter opener with the initials "H.W." engraved on the handle.
        The blade shows traces of blood and the distinctive design matches similar pieces
        given as gifts to political supporters. This particular model was made exclusively
        for Congressman Harold Williams' campaign donors.

      name: "Passionate Correspondence"
      description: |-
        A bundle of letters tied with red ribbon, hidden in Stella's personal effects.
        The handwriting is educated, the stationary expensive, and the content... explosive.
        Detailed descriptions of intimate encounters, promises of leaving his wife,
        and increasingly desperate pleas for discretion as election season approaches.

      name: "Medical Examination Results"
      description: |-
        A doctor's report confirming Stella was two months pregnant at time of death.
        The discrete clinic on the east side specializes in treating working girls
        and asks no questions. The timing corresponds exactly with the congressman's
        most frequent visits to the Red Lantern.

      description: |-
        Professional-quality photographs hidden in Madame Rouge's safe showing various
        prominent citizens in compromising positions within the Red Lantern.
        Stella appears in several images with different men, including clear shots

      name: "Personal Journal"
      description: |-
        Stella's private diary reveals an intelligent woman documenting everything
        around her. Detailed entries about clients, their secrets, their weaknesses.
        The final entry, dated the night of her murder, mentions meeting someone
        about 'changing everything' and 'finally getting what I deserve.'

      name: "Unexplained Wealth"
      description: |-
        Bank records showing Stella had been depositing large sums of money
        far beyond what her work at the Red Lantern would provide. The deposits
        correspond with visits from wealthy clients, suggesting she was already
        blackmailing them successfully before her death.

      testimony: |-
        "I was finishing my last set around midnight when I heard raised voices from upstairs.
        A man's voice - educated, angry. Stella's voice too, but defiant, not scared.
        Then it went quiet. Too quiet. I went to check on her later but Tony said
        she had a client and not to disturb. That was unusual - Stella always
        said goodnight after my last song."

      witness: "working_girl_violet"
      testimony: |-
        "Stella thought she was so smart, better than the rest of us. She was planning
        something big - kept talking about 'one last score' and then she'd be set for life.
        She was stealing clients too, telling them lies about me to make herself look better.
        That night... I heard her arguing with someone but I was with my own client.
        I swear I was! Mr. Peterson can vouch for me until at least 1 AM."

      testimony: |-
        "Around 1:30, I was doing my rounds when I saw someone climbing down the fire escape
        from the upstairs windows. Dark coat, hat pulled low, moved like someone who
        knew their way around. Didn't get a good look at the face, but they were in a hurry.
        Thought it was odd - usually clients leave through the front like gentlemen."

      testimony: |-
        "I see everything from this alley, nobody pays attention to an old soldier.
        That fancy car with the government plates? Been here three times this week.
        Tonight the driver waited in the alley instead of out front - that's not normal.
        Saw someone in expensive clothes climb down that fire escape, get in the car real quick.
        Recognize that face from the newspapers - that politician always talking about morality."

  forensic_analysis:
    - id: "blood_spatter_analysis"
      description: |-
        Blood patterns in Room 7 indicate the victim was struck while facing her attacker.
        The angle and distribution suggest someone taller than Stella, consistent with
        most male suspects. No defensive wounds indicate surprise attack or someone
        she trusted enough to turn her back on.

        Multiple sets of fingerprints found throughout Room 7, as expected in a brothel.
        The murder weapon, however, shows only two clear sets: Stella's and one other
        set that matches prints found on the love letters and other personal items
        belonging to Congressman Williams.

    - id: "time_of_death"
      description: |-
        Medical examination places death between midnight and 2 AM. Body temperature,
        rigor mortis, and other factors narrow it to likely between 12:30 and 1:15 AM.
        This timeline is crucial for verifying alibis and witness statements.
