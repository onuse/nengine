# Example: Game-Specific Model Tier Configuration
# This shows how a game can override default model selections

# Add this to your game.yaml to customize model selection per VRAM tier:

llm:
  model: "nous-hermes2:7b-dpo-q4_K_M"  # Will be overridden by auto-detection
  fallbackModel: "dolphin-mixtral:8x7b"
  temperature: 0.8
  contextWindow: 8192
  autoDetectModels: true     # Set to false to disable auto-detection
  preferUncensored: true     # Request uncensored models (for adult content games)

game:
  maturity_rating: "adult"   # Also triggers uncensored model selection
  content_warnings: ["adult_themes", "violence"]  # Presence of warnings triggers uncensored

# Custom model preferences by VRAM tier
modelTiers:
  # For 8GB VRAM systems (RTX 4060 Ti, RTX 3070)
  gaming:
    primary: "wizardlm-uncensored:7b"        # Game prefers this for primary
    fallback: "nous-hermes2:7b-dpo-q4_K_M"  # Custom fallback
    uncensored: "openchat:7b-q4_K_M"        # Different uncensored choice
    
  # For 16GB VRAM systems (RTX 4080, RTX A4000)
  enthusiast:
    primary: "nous-hermes2:13b-uncensored"
    fallback: "mixtral:8x7b-q4_K_M" 
    uncensored: "wizard-vicuna:13b-uncensored"
    
  # For 24GB VRAM systems (RTX 4090, RTX A6000)
  prosumer:
    primary: "nous-hermes2:34b-uncensored-q4_K_M"
    fallback: "llama3.1:32b"
    uncensored: "goliath:30b-uncensored"
    
  # For 64GB+ VRAM workstations
  workstation:
    primary: "llama3.1:70b-q4_K_M"
    fallback: "mixtral:8x22b-q4_K_M"
    uncensored: "goliath:120b-uncensored-q2_K"

# How it works:
# 1. System detects 8GB VRAM â†’ selects "gaming" tier
# 2. Game has custom modelTiers.gaming config
# 3. System uses wizardlm-uncensored:7b instead of default
# 4. For adult games, system picks "uncensored" model: openchat:7b-q4_K_M
# 5. Fallback becomes nous-hermes2:7b-dpo-q4_K_M

# Benefits:
# - Each game can optimize for its specific needs
# - Adult games get truly uncensored models
# - Technical games can prefer coding-focused models  
# - RPG games can prefer creative writing models
# - Always falls back to system defaults if not specified
