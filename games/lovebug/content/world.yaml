      The door swings open to reveal an elegantly appointed Parisian hotel room bathed in soft amber light.
      Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the glittering city lights, the Eiffel Tower visible in the distance.
      The room is spacious, dominated by a massive king-size bed with plush cream linens.

      But you're not alone.

      Four stunning women are here, lounging in various states of comfort. The air is thick with expensive perfume,
      and soft jazz plays from a speaker somewhere. Wine bottles and glasses sit on the marble coffee table.
      They all turn to look at you with expressions of surprise that quickly morph into something more intriguing.
      Sophie is sitting shyly on the edge of the bed, her eyes wide with a mix of nervousness and curiosity.
