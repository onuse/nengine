      The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, winding its way between steep rocky outcroppings. 
      Two dead horses lie in the road ahead, their saddlebags torn open and contents scattered. 
      Black-feathered arrows jut from their flanks. The woods press close on both sides of the trail.
      
      This is about five miles outside of Phandalin, where you were hired to escort supplies.

    description: |
      Examining the scene more closely, you find signs of a struggle. The horses have been dead for about a day.
      Drag marks lead into the brush on the north side of the road. An empty leather map case lies trampled in the mud.
      
      A successful Investigation check might reveal goblin tracks and a hidden trail.

    description: |
      Following the stream, you come upon a cave entrance in a hillside five miles from the ambush site.

      A narrow, dry path runs alongside the stream, littered with well-gnawed bones.

      The cave mouth curves sharply to the east after about 20 feet. A stream emerges from deeper in the cave, flowing westward. The air is damp and smells of wet dog and rotting meat.
      
      On either side of the stream, the cavern floor is smooth but damp, rising in a gentle slope toward the back.

    name: "Wave Echo Cave"
    description: |
      Hidden in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, this is the lost mine that the Rockseeker brothers sought.
      The entrance is partially collapsed, but a passage remains open. From within, you hear a rhythmic booming sound,
      like the pounding of waves against a shore - the echo that gives the cave its name.
      
      This was once the site of the Phandelver's Pact, where dwarves and gnomes worked alongside human spellcasters.

      Undermountain is the deepest and deadliest dungeon in all Faerun.
      
      The room at the bottom of the well is lit by phosphorescent fungi. Graffiti from previous adventurers
      covers the walls, most of it warnings. Passages lead off in all directions.

      This is the domain of treants, elves, and far stranger things. The Grandfather Tree,
      the oldest living thing in the North, is said to dwell somewhere in these depths.
