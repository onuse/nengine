  # Extra instructions for the heist theme
  extraInstructions: |
    This is a noir heist game with tension and suspense.

    Style Guidelines:
    - Use tense, atmospheric descriptions
    - Build suspense through pacing and detail
    - NPCs should be complex with hidden agendas
    - Describe environmental sounds and shadows
    - Keep the player on edge

    Every decision matters. Trust is earned slowly and lost quickly.
