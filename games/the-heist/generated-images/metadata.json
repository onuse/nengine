    "prompt": "A dimly lit, beige-walled room with a cold, gray linoleum floor, illuminated by a flickering fluorescent light overhead, casting eerie shadows. A worn, frayed armchair sits in the corner, accompanied by a small, metal table with an empty ashtray. A plain metal door with a keycard lock is the sole exit. Lena, a woman with sharp angles, piercing green eyes, and raven-black hair in a tight ponytail, wears a black leather jacket and a silver necklace with an intricately designed pendant. Her gaze is intense, sizing you up. The air is stale, heavy with stagnation and decay, with a hint of tension. Lena's low, husky voice speaks, 'You're awake...My name is Lena. You've been...indisposed for a while. You don't remember, do you?' The atmosphere is ominous, with a soft creaking of the armchair and a growing hum of the fluorescent light, as Lena waits for a response, her eyes narrowing, 'We need to talk. About the job. And what happened.'",
